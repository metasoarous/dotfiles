There is a lot of unspoken magick around lein releases.

1. Leave project with `-SNAPSHOT` version (if alpha or beta, do `0.0.1-alpha1-SNAPSHOT` (e.g.).
2. Create an uberjar of the project `lein uberjar`.
3. Deploy the snapshot:
    a. Directly as a snapshot: `lein deploy clojars`
    b. As a release: `lein deploy clojars datsync 0.0.1-alpha1-SNAPSHOT`
4. Increment version number.

Keep in mind it pays to have clojars credentials set up in `~/.lein/credentials.clj.pgp`, and you'll need pgp
with a working agent to sign releases as well.
I had to upgrade from gpg1 to gpg2.
