## Finding all listening ports

    nmap -sT -O server

server can be either localhost, an ip, etc



## Find all open ip addresses in a range

It should be possible to do with with

    nmap -sP "192.168.1.*"

But this seems to frequently miss things.
You can always just use Angry IP scanner.
This has the added advantage of being multithreaded for very much fastness.


# Wireless / wifi

    ifconfig

## Scan for wireless networks

    iwlist wlanX s

## Connect to wpa secured network
