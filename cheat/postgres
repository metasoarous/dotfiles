# Postgres!

The database you love to hate!


## System quirks

I'm having a bit of a hard time getting postgres to behave.
Need to pass

  psql -U <username> -W -h localhost <db>

all explicitly for anything to work.
`-W` and `-h` are supposed to be defaults, but no love here.


## Dumping/Restoring

This is a good guide: <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/backup-dump.html>

  pg_dump dbname > dumpfile
  psql dbname < dumpfile

You'll probably need the settings above, with `-U postgres` for this to work.


## Environment variables

PGHOST
PGDATABASE
PGUSER
PGPASSWORD
