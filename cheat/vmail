In the below <ll> corresponds to local leader. By default, this is ",", but I like that for my main leader, so
I've set this to "\". This can be done with

    :set maplocalleader = "\\"

## misc notes

If saving a draft locally, make sure to save as *.txt; apparently, vmail needs this to know to reload...
