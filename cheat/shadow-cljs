# Shadow-CLJS

Mostly straight forward; Example `shadow-cljs.edn`:

    {:dependencies [[blah "x.x.x"]]
     :builds { }}


## vim-fireplace REPL connection...

I can never remember how to do this, so here:

    :Connect <port>
    :CljEval (shadow/repl :<build-id>)

Not quite fully working, probably cause I don't have cider set up on project in question...
Also may depend on how project is set up, whether it has clj side or not.
All from here:
